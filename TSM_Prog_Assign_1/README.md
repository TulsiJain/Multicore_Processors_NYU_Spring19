# Steps to run on

1. make p=number_of_cities t=number_of_threads

## Plots
The plots showing speedup over single-thread version for both the  problem of size 5 cities and 10 cities is shown below for the second implementation. The x-axis the number of threads (1 to num of cities) and y-axis is the <b>(1/total time)<b> generated by time command. 
												*<small> averaged over (~5) times. <small>
